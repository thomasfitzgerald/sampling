## Why I am interested in data science
### Thank you for taking the time to view this document

I have the following aims for this course:  
* improve understanding of data science  
* improve data analytics skills  
* refine questions to improve training and nutrition solutions

The use of data will be invaluable for gaining insights to help people better-mangage their body composiiton. At the current time, we are too focused on providing information to the end-user and then relying on their implementation. My aim is to use data analytics to provide interventions that can be delivered to the users, instead of solely education.

You can find out more about me using at my website [Integrated Fitness & Nutrition](https://www.integratedfitnessnutrition.com/).

I have written a lot of articles on trianing and nutrition for body composition and I have a photo on each one, such as this.
