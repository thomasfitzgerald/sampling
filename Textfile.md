I have the following aims for this course:
* improve understanding of data science
* improve data analytics skills
* refine questions to improve training and nutrition solutions

The use of data will be invaluable for gaining insights to help people better-mangage their body composiiton. At the current time, we are too focused on providing information to the end-user and then relying on their implementation. My aim is to use data analytics to provide interventions that can be delivered to the users, instead of solely education.
